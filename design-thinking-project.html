                    <h2 class="major">Design Thinking Project</h2>
                    
                   <p>
    We carried out a design thinking project that took two months to complete. After continuous effort, we successfully completed the project.
    Our group designed an application called <strong>AutiCont</strong>, which focuses on autism. The target users are parents and teachers, as they are the people
    closest to autistic children. As we know, autistic children may feel stressed when they face problems, but they are often unable to express
    their emotions. As a result, parents and teachers may not be able to intervene at an early stage.
</p>

<p>
    The main strength of AutiCont is its ability to detect the heartbeat of an autistic child, allowing parents and teachers to monitor the child in real time.
    If the child’s heartbeat rises above a certain level, AutiCont will trigger notifications and alarms to alert parents and teachers.
    In addition, AutiCont summarises the overall heartbeat data over a specific period, such as weekly or monthly result.
    This makes it easier for parents and teachers to track the times when the child experiences stress.
</p>

<p>
    In my opinion, AutiCont is useful for parents and teachers because they often feel stressed when taking care of autistic children and need to constantly
    focus on the child’s emotional condition to prevent accidents or self-harm. Therefore, if AutiCont exists, their lives will become easier by reducing
    the stress involved in monitoring the child.
</p>

<p>
    Our idea is AutiCont can be downloaded from the Play Store. However, not all smartwatches are equipped with a stress-monitoring sensor that can detect
    stress levels. This is a weakness that needs further improvement. Nevertheless, we believe that stress-monitoring sensors will be widely used in the future,
    as people are increasingly surrounded by stress and need effective ways to manage it in order to prevent mental illness.
    Therefore, this sensor will be highly beneficial to society in the future.
