      <p> <strong>REFELECTION</strong> </p>

                    
                    <p>
    From the speaker, we learned about the importance of Project Management and System Development in every project.
    A clear plan is always needed to ensure the efficient use of time and resources while minimising risks and unexpected problems during development.
    In addition, project management skills help us coordinate with designers, testers, and other developers more effectively.
    The speaker also mentioned that we need to work smartly with AI to improve productivity.
    There are also some core skills that we need to master, such as requirement gathering, system design, and AI-assisted development.

    I think this industry talk was really useful for students and does not require any improvement, as we learned many new things.
    The concept of working smart rather than hard is important.
    These essential skills are necessary to make our projects easier to carry out.
    Effective ways of completing a project are important for everyone involved.
