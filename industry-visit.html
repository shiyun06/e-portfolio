                     <p> <strong>REFELECTION</strong> </p>
                    
                    <p>During the industry visit, I learned that nowadays many systems involve coding. Although Biocon Sdn. Bhd. prefers workers 
                        with a background in information technology, they still accept employees from any background. Work ability is more important 
                        than anything else. They do not mind gender or appearance and encourage employees to just be themselves. I was particularly 
                        impressed by their inclusive management approach. </p>

                    <p>For me, I think it was a very successful industry visit and do not need any improvement, as students were able to understand industry operations. For instance, 
                        we learned how businesses operate, including workflow, quality control, safety measures, and organisational structure. Again, 
                        I really appreciate the individuals involved in organising this industry visit, especially the staff of Biocon Sdn. Bhd. and our lecturer, 
                        for ensuring that the visit was well coordinated and successful. </p>
