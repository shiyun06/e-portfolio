                    <p> 
                        During the PC Assemble lab session, we learned how to
                        assemble and disassemble a personal computer systematically.
                        The lecturer explained the function of each component and the proper usage of tools clearly
                        Whcih helped us to undertsand the role of every part in the system. Throughout the lab, we 
                        followed lecturer's instruction step by step, ensuring that each component was
                        take out and dissembly and assembly. This lab seesion was very beneficial to me because 
                        it allowed me to gain hands-on experience and a clearer understanding of the internal structure of a 
                        PC.I not only learned the theoretical knowledge, but I was also able to operate the various components in 
                        practice and observe how they are connected and work together.
                        It was also my first time learning about computer components in detail,
                        which increase my confidence and interest in hardware-related topics.
                    </p>

                    <p>I think this lab activity was helpful to the students that involved and do not need any improvement. All of the students were
                        enjoying during the section as we gained fun and useful details.
