      <p> <strong>REFELECTION</strong> </p>
                    <p>
                        PPG Industry is a global supplier of paints, coating and specialty materials.
                        From the talk, I realised that we need to master multiple skills such as programming language and database design.
                        To apply these important skills effectively, we must continuosly learn and improve knowledge.
                        The more we learn, the more we gain. In addition, teamwork is an important skill that we need 
                        to develop in order to ensure effective communication and high project quality.

                        

                    </p>
                    <p>I believe there is no need for improvement in this talk, as the information delivered 
                        by the speakers was clear and well-structured. The students gained a great deal of additional 
                        knowledge and a better understanding of the company’s background. Overall, the talk was highly 
                        beneficial and useful for students.</p>
