                        At 10:00am, we reached at UTM Digital and we attend an Insutrial talk entitled "UTM InsightX6-System Development".
                    </p>
                     <p> <strong>REFELECTION</strong> </p>
                    <P>During the talk, Dr Helmee Bin Yacood focused on the experiences and best practices of IT project management within UTM Digital, 
                        particularly concerning the in-house development of critical systems like the HR and Finance applications. He highlighted the importance of 
                        transitioning from the traditional Waterfall approach to the more adaptive Agile methodology.  Agile allows for project requirements to evolve 
                        and changes to happen frequently, dividing the work into short cycles or iterations for faster delivery of small functions within one to four weeks. 
                        This approach promotes customer satisfaction by involving stakeholders from the early stages of system development, in contrast to the Waterfall method 
                        where customers only receive the application at the end. </P>
                        <p>To ensure successful project delivery and avoid common pitfalls, UTM Digital emphasizes thorough planning, requirement gathering, 
                            and managing risks. The speaker detailed reasons for project failure, including poor preparation, bad leadership, scope creep, 
                            and a lack of communication across all levels. UTM Digital counteracts these issues by assigning senior system analysts to 
                            manage projects and involving stakeholders from the start. They implement DevOps practices and utilize tools like Taiga and GitLab, 
                            with daily stand-up meetings to coordinate tasks and resolve issues. Furthermore, all applications are developed in-house, supported by 
                            both permanent and contract staff, using the Oracle Database (19c) as the main backbone for digital transformation.
                        
                        <p>By refering the interview from staff, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) currently operates many digital systems to support students and staff, 
                             such as e-learning platforms, G-SMS, MyAIMS, RADIS, UTM Lab and ICES. UTM Smart is a platform that useful to all users which integrates multiple services.
                             As technology is constantly evolving, UTM continues to improve its systems by adopting emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI).
                             For example, iCombo implements blockchain-based digital certificates that are secure and tamper-proof, while an AI-powered chatbot is being developed to assist users 
                             in UTM Smart. These initiatives show UTM’s commitment to digital transformation and continuous improvement to better serve the university community.
                            </p>
                            <p>For me, I walked around the booths and visited a booth that produces CCTV systems. From that booth, I learned about the features and functions 
                                of the CCTV. Therefore, I think that this Open Day provided a lot of useful information if we took the time to attend the activities. 
                                In addition, UTM students did not need to go outside to participate in the activities because the event was held within the UTM campus.</p>
                        <p>I think that more days are needed for the Open Day because there were many activities, talks, and booths provided for students. 
                            Due to the limited time, it was difficult for students to visit every booth and fully participate in all the activities. 
                            Extending the Open Day would allow students to explore more exhibitions, attend more talks, and gain deeper understanding 
                            from the information shared. This would further enhance students’ knowledge and make the Open Day experience more meaningful and beneficial.</p>
